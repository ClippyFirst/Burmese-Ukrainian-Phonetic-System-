# Romanization engine research — Burmese

**Date:** 2026-10-28  
**Repository:** https://github.com/ClippyFirst/Burmese-Ukrainian-Phonetic-System-  
**Status:** RESEARCH_COMPLETE / RUNTIME_INTEGRATION_TODO

## User-facing requirement

Add a separate Latin-script romanization result alongside the source text, IPA, and Ukrainian practical transcription. The result must be described as a romanization system, not as English spelling, translation, IPA, or Ukrainian transcription. It must preserve whitespace and punctuation, expose the chosen profile, and never infer pronunciation merely because a source grapheme was parsed.

## Candidate review

### Standards and reference data

- Unicode CLDR transliteration guidelines: https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/transliteration-guidelines
- CLDR transforms are versioned and include language/script-specific data. The CLDR release notes list the relevant transforms: https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-43
- UNGEGN's current inventory of romanization systems: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/ungegn/romanization/
- BGN/PCGN systems are officially described as geographical-name romanization systems; they should not automatically be advertised as a universal standard for all prose: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/romanization-systems

### Cross-language engines

1. **Aksharamukha** — broad script and romanization coverage, including Khmer, Lao, Burmese/Myanmar and Sinhala; offers readable/colloquial and scholarly romanization profiles. Upstream project declares AGPL-3.0, so it must not be bundled into this repository without a deliberate licensing compatibility decision. References: https://github.com/virtualvinodh/aksharamukha and https://github.com/paramsiddharth/aksharamukha.js
2. **inditrans** — browser/WASM, MIT-licensed, supports Khmer, Burmese and Sinhala but does not list Lao in its supported-script enum. Its ITRANS/Indlish outputs are generic romanization not a substitute for a national system. References: https://github.com/vm75/inditrans and https://github.com/vm75/inditrans/blob/main/nodejs/README.md
3. **uroman** — multilingual, context-aware universal romanizer, with documented improvements for Khmer and general South/Southeast Asian scripts. It is useful as a baseline/comparator but does not claim to implement each language's national romanization standard, and the maintained release is Python rather than a drop-in browser engine. References: https://github.com/isi-nlp/uroman and https://aclanthology.org/P18-4003/
4. **Unicode CLDR transforms** — permissively reusable, versioned rule data and the best starting point for an offline/local implementation where available. The transform must be evaluated for this language's coverage and behavior rather than assumed to be a pronunciation engine.

## Language-specific decision

**Preferred reference:** CLDR Myanmar→Latin transform, with BGN/PCGN/UNGEGN tables retained as a separately named geographic-name profile where applicable. Aksharamukha covers Burmese but is AGPL-3.0; inditrans is MIT and supports Burmese, but its generic notation must not be mislabeled as an official national system.

The current browser parser is explicitly conservative and sometimes withholds IPA. Romanization may still provide an orthographic candidate, but its status must remain independent from the IPA and Ukrainian statuses. Preserve Unicode Myanmar input and never normalize Zawgyi implicitly as if it were Unicode. Source context: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/romanization-systems and https://unstats.un.org/unsd/ungegn/romanization/

## Required architecture

Keep the following outputs independent:

`source orthography → existing structural/phonological analysis → IPA`

and

`source orthography → selected orthographic romanization profile → Latin-script result`

The romanizer must not read IPA or the Ukrainian result as its source, and adding romanization must not change existing IPA or Ukrainian behavior. If a profile cannot handle a token, preserve the original token and mark the romanization as partial instead of silently dropping or guessing.

## Acceptance criteria before marking implementation complete

- [ ] A local/browser-compatible engine is pinned and its exact license is recorded.
- [ ] Profile name, version/source and intended scope are visible in the UI.
- [ ] Romanization is produced for sentences, mixed punctuation and spaces without destroying boundaries.
- [ ] Tests cover source-script recognition, combining marks, representative words and sentences, digits/punctuation, unknown characters, and mixed-script input.
- [ ] Reference cases are sourced and explicitly distinguished from merely plausible examples.
- [ ] Romanization changes do not alter IPA or Ukrainian results.
- [ ] Browser tests verify the output panel and copy action.
- [ ] CI and Pages deployment pass on the exact candidate commit.
- [ ] The canonical master execution plan and handoff record the implementation SHA and exact test results.

## Current truthful status

The candidate survey is complete. Runtime integration is **not** complete in this commit. No engine output, accuracy score, or passing test is claimed here. Do not mark the site as having a working romanizer until the above gates pass.
